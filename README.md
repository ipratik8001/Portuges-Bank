Problem Statement  Task 1: Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.  Task 2: Create a predictive model which will help the bank marketing team to know which customer [profile] will buy the product.  Task 3: Suggestions to the Bank market team to make customers buy the product.

Insights

While age represents a person’s life stage and balance represents a person’s financial condition, jointly evaluating the impact of these two factors enables us to investigate if there is a common trend across all ages, and to identify which combination of client features indicates the highest likelihood of subscription.

In order to investigate the combined effect of age and balance on a client’s decision, we performed a two-layer grouping, segmenting customers according to their balance levels within each age group.

The graph tells the same story regarding the subscription rate for different age groups: the willingness to subscribe is exceptionally high for people aged above 60 and younger people aged below 30 also have a distinguishable higher subscription rate than those of other age groups.

Furthermore, the effect of balance levels on subscription decision is applicable to each individual age group: every age group shares a common trend that the percentage of subscription increases with balance.

In sum, the bank should prioritize its telemarketing to clients who are above 60 years old and have positive balances, because they have the highest acceptance rate of about 35%. The next group the bank should focus on is young clients with positive balances, who showed high subscription rates between 15% and 20%.

Final Observations
The main objective of this project is to test the accuracy of models and develop a new model to predict the success of bank telemarketing.

From the above model implementation, we can see that all models performed well except for SVM.

Challenges

As a result, no general agreement can be reached regarding the features that are most important to the effectiveness of bank telemarketing prediction across all the techniques used.

Additional Observation(s)

Additionally, customers with administrative positions make up the majority of those who have subscribed to the term deposit, with technicians making up the second-largest group.

A large number of our former clients have applied for a house loan, while very few have done so for a personal loan. The preferred method of contacting clients appears to be via cell phones and most clients were contacted in the month of May.
